= VAST

A library for parsing Digital Video Ad Serving Template (VAST) documents, as outlined by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at 
http://www.iab.net/iab_products_and_industry_services/508676/digitalvideo/vast. This library strives to be as true to the 
standard as possible, while presenting a Ruby-friendly interface.

VAST outlines a standard document format for communication between digital video players and ad servers, including support for 
multiple forms of creative and tracking support that conforms to the latest IAB standards.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
